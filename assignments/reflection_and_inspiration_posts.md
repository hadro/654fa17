## Background

Library, museum and information center technologies is an expansive
topic. While we'll cover a variety of essential elements, there's a
great deal of depth we won't be able to get to during class time
together.

Moreover, library technology, more so than many other areas within the
profession, is subject to an increasingly rapid pace of upheaval. What
was considered a staple library service just a few years ago may now be
fading in importance, or worse, obsolete. For these reasons and others,
keeping current with emerging issues and technologies is something that
will be required of all people working in libraries and the information
professions.

The class blog is an opportunity for students to direct their additional
readings and media observation in a direction of their choosing in order
to supplement more specific interests and tracks/programs within Pratt
SILS. For example, students interested in digital preservation issues
may wish to focus their posts on current preservation concerns, while a
student on the LMS track may wish to focus on Internet filtering issues
or the efficacy of tablet readers in a classroom setting.

Technology & Service Inspiration Posts
======================================

Students will contribute at least three short posts to the class blog
over the course of the semester. See the syllabus and class blog for a
non-exhaustive list of potential sources.

These are meant to be brief annotated citations of services. Students
should search LIS literature sources as well as news sources and other
media for examples—large or small—that relate to the use of technology
in the provision of service. They can be citations of innovative
services currently being offered by libraries or archives, or examples
from other industries that could potentially be applied to those
environments. Examples can range from “soft technology” — e.g., social
media, smartphone apps, etc. — to more granular and complex technology
examples, like Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), scripting
tools, information visualization applications, etc.

**Technology & Service Inspiration Posts Requirements**

-   150-word minimum (original post content; not including excerpt or
    citation, etc.)

-   Published to class blog by the time class starts on the due date

    -   With descriptive title

    -   Categorizes appropriately, e.g., Technology & Service
        Inspiration Post 1, Technology & Service Inspiration Post
        2, etc.

    -   Tagged with relevant keywords

    -   Use only the “standard” post format option

-   Excerpt or embed of source material

    -   Includes citations of any source material, with links embedded
        if possible

-   Brief comment about why the cited example is of interest, and how it
    is being or could be deployed in a library or archive context

    -   Addresses, briefly, at least the following questions:

        -   What is new and/or noteworthy here?

        -   Why should people in the library field be paying attention
            to this particular development?


Reflection Posts
===================

Students will contribute at least three significant posts to the class
blog over the course of the semester. See below for initial topic
suggestions, and see the syllabus and class blog for a non-exhaustive
list of potential sources.

The posts should be a minimum of 700 words in length, and must include:
an excerpted portion (**not** to be included in the word count) or embed
(with Fair Use criteria in mind; see below) and direct link to the
source; a brief summary or explanation of the material with comment on
how the material was discovered; and the student's reflection, drawing
connections and parallels to material covered in class and/or ongoing
concerns to the library and archives communities.

**Reflection Posts Requirements**

-   700-word minimum (original post content; not including excerpt or
    citation, etc.)

-   Published to class blog by the time class starts on the due date

    -   With descriptive title

    -   Categorizes appropriately, e.g., Reflection Post 1, Reflection
        Post 2, etc.

    -   Tagged with relevant keywords

    -   Use only the “standard” post format option

-   Excerpt or embed of source material

    -   Includes citations of any source material, with links embedded
        links if possible

-   Brief summary or explanatory remarks about source material

-   Reflection on material in context of class topics and larger
    library/info sci discussions

    -   Addresses at least the following questions:

        -   How are the sources under consideration in the post deeply
            relevant to the library and information science profession?

        -   How does this tie to larger technology trends or
            implications?

        -   Why should people in the library field be paying attention
            to this particular development?

-   Two concluding questions that prompt further consideration of the
    topic

**Note on writing style/tone:**

Write what feels comfortable, and helps you get your point across.

No need to be overly formal as long as what you write is expressed
clearly and effectively.

If it helps you frame your posts, feel free to consider your audience to
be both me and your class peers, eager to hear from the periodic updates
on relevant materials you’ve discovered in the course of this class.

Meanwhile, I also suggest that you consider re-publishing the posts you
write for this class in other places, such as your own blog, on
Medium.com, or elsewhere. They can be great fodder as writing samples,
especially if you consider that kind of re-use ahead of time.

**Potential post topics (to name just a few):**  
The Gender Gap in library technology  
Creative Commons and Copyleft  
Are ebooks a threat to libraries?  
Does digital preservation obviate the need for physical storage?  
The Digital Public Library of America: potential and reality  
Consumer technology influence on library practice  
Library use of social media vs. personal/professional use of social
media  
Libraries and open source software: is there a professional mandate to
use these tools?  
The evolution of library electronic resources: moving from text to
video, and beyond  
The Cloud – what does that even mean? What does it mean for library
users?  
Streaming media: should libraries offer streaming music and video
services to their patrons? If so, what should the delivery mechanism
look like?

**Potential starting place**  
If you’re struggling for a place to start, consider reading and
responding to **Library Services in the Digital Age** from the Pew
Internet & American Life Project or **Perceptions of Libraries, 2010:
Context and Community** from OCLC as a jumping-off point (though please
also feel free to use other supporting articles, reports, or media to
support your post as you see fit):

-   <http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2013/01/22/Library-services/>

-   <http://www.oclc.org/reports/2010perceptions.en.html>

If you choose the OCLC report, consider in particular the sections "How
Americans Use Online Sources and Their Libraries," "The Library Brand
2010," and "A Long View: Looking Forward."

Appendix: On Fair Use
=====================

Fair use is an extremely important facet of the information industry,
and is an essential component of the law to understand and be able to
clearly communicate to patrons, researchers, students, and anyone else
who might benefit from fair use.

17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
--------------------------------------------------------------

<http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107>

> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections
> [106](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) and
> [106A](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A), the fair use
> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
> factors to be considered shall include—

1.  <span id="1" class="anchor"></span>**the purpose and character of
    the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is
    for nonprofit educational purposes;** <span id="2"
    class="anchor"></span>

2.  **the nature of the copyrighted work;**

3.  <span id="3" class="anchor"></span>**the amount and substantiality
    of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole;
    and**

4.  <span id="4" class="anchor"></span>**the effect of the use upon the
    potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.**

> ---

The following are the best and most succinct informal criteria for fair
use I’ve heard:

1.  *Are you using the material to illustrate a specific point that
    you’re trying to make?*

2.  *Are you only using so much as is necessary to make that point?*

3.  *Is it clear to the audience what that point is?*

Ruling as
